kind: Scheduled
description: |-
  Investigate the Cause

  Review the Microsoft Sentinel Cost and Workspace Usage Report Workbooks to determine which tables are consuming the most storage and why. 



  Mitigate Immediate Impact
  Reduce Overload:
  Temporarily filter or throttle non-critical logs at the source or SIEM ingestion point.
  Expand storage or processing resources if the threshold was exceeded due to legitimate volume increases.
  Stabilize SIEM: Check for and address any performance degradation in the SIEM system.
